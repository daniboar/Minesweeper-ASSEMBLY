Minesweeper game made using Assembly as part of my Assembly Language Programming class.
I implemented an 8x8 Minesweeper game.
The game contains 10 bombs that I placed on the positions.
It ends when we manage not to touch any bomb, or in the unfortunate case when we touch a square where the bomb is.
